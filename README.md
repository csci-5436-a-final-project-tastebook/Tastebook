Tastebook is a user-based website which gives visitors the freedom to search for recipes and also post new ones they may have on their own. When publicly launched, our site will securely maintain basic membersâ€™ information, such as user name, password, recipes posted, and liked recipes. The site is designed to provide users with an easy to use online recipe book that can be accessed anywhere with an internet connection.
